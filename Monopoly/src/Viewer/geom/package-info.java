/**
 * Utility classes related to geometry computations, mainly targeting
 * the classes from the <code>java.awt.geom</code> package.
 * <p>
 * For most of the classes and interfaces of the <code>java.awt.geom</code>
 * package, there is a corresponding class that contains utility methods:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>java.awt.geom.Point2D : de.javagl.geom.Points</li>
 *   <li>java.awt.geom.Line2D : de.javagl.geom.Liness</li>
 *   <li>java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D : de.javagl.geom.Rectangles</li>
 *   <li>java.awt.geom.Path2D : de.javagl.geom.Paths</li>
 *   <li>java.awt.geom.Shape : de.javagl.geom.Shapes</li>
 *   <li>java.awt.geom.AffineTransform : de.javagl.geom.AffineTransforms</li>
 * </ul>
 * For the primitives, these classes contain utility methods that in
 * general allow modifications of the primitives that are implemented
 * aiming at high performance and low memory overhead. For example,
 * most of the methods have an <i>optional</i> parameter that may 
 * store the transformed result, and will return this result parameter,
 * or create a new object internally when the result parameter 
 * was <code>null</code>.<br>
 * <br>
 * The remaining classes deal with tasks that frequently occur in 
 * geometry-heavy applications. All these classes should be considered
 * as being <b>preliminary</b>, meaning that they might be moved to
 * different packages, or minor details of the interfaces may change,
 * but their basic functionality will then still be available in a
 * similar (and possibly extended) form.
